Imagine a scenario where you're grappling with difficulties in remembering answers or solutions in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Even after solving a particular problem, recalling the solution during subsequent attempts remains challenging.

The theory suggests a practical approach: write down each answer in its designated space without the accompanying question or function name. After 2-3 days, attempt to recall the original question solely based on the answer. This exercise enhances your memory retention and strengthens your grasp of concepts over time.

This website provides a platform specifically designed for this purpose. You can input your DSA code snippets here, omitting the associated questions. Later, after a few days, you can review the answers and challenge yourself to remember the corresponding questions.

Additionally, the site includes options to delete and edit your entries, ensuring a personalized and effective learning experience.
